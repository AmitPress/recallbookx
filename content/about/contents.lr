body:

Hi, I am Amit. I am currently a student of Bachelors degree in East West University.
My interest is in Algorithms and Data Structures. I have done a little bit of CP as well. But not that much. I wish I could be regular.
Again, if you have interest in Compilers and Interpreters, do bookmark this website.
